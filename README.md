# parsertest
This is just a test for parser

code is messy but heavily commented so hopefully it'll be understandable once you read it

the first string initialized, str, is the string that will be parsed. Change that if testing code.

The parser will save the connectors and commands in separate vectors, con and cmd, and display both vectors at the end.
Currently, the parser outputs a lot (many of the lines in parse() are just cout statements). This is to make it easier to visualize the parsing steps, and will be removed later.
